# Config files for SWAP/SWAPSHOP
These config files contain the initial parameters used for each run. In general, parameters that change between these runs are the following: 

* `initialPL`: sets the initial probability of a user to classify SMOOTH
* `initialPD`: sets the initial probability of a user to classify NOT
* `detection_threshold`: Changing these values significantly alters outcomes -- quantify by how much
* `rejection_threshold`
* `prior`: currently set at 0.3 based on various literature values for the local universe. Test whether this value significantly changes outcomes.
